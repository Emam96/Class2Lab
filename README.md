# Class2Lab 

* How did this go, overall?
* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

## day 1

1. It was hard at first, I was confused for a while but then I managed to complete the whole thing. 
2. I noticed that you can do or run a code with different ways, it goes back to what is the **best act**, mine was not. 
3. it tool me nearly 2 hours, I thought I would finish in an hour. 


## day 2 

1. it was hard and its still hard.... a lot
2. Im not good at javascript as I thought I would be, so I need to improve. 
3. it took the whole day. 





## day 3 

1. it was easy, ahmed is great and our work was smooth and fast. I learned some good stuff from him also
2. The hardest part was pulling the repos again after doing the work, we faced a problem and solved it using the terminal
3. Im improving at Javascript, better every day
4. it 2 hours maybe








**I fixed my code form the previous lab and added the new required question, I used a mix between while loops and if statement to preview the first 4 questions. 
I then used a for loop for the 5th questions after that I used another for loop for the final question, but this time it takes the parameters form an array. 
The score dashboard is made from a function that adds +1 for every correct answer, it works by calling it at every correct input.** 



 **we added functions to the both repos and improved each other codes**
